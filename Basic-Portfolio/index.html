            <p>Hello! A little about me. Oh geez, I haven't done one of 
                these since myspace. So I'm from the usually hot and sunny 
                city of Tucson, Arizona. Born and raised.
                I've worked in restaurants since I could start working. 
                Sushi kinda fell into my lap. One late night while bussing a table, 
                the head sushi chef of Sakura asked me
                if I wanted to learn the trade. Enthusiastically I replied, 
                "Of course!" And have been doing it ever since. That was about 
                10 years ago, and since then I've been doing it.
                Though, now, I feel I should move on to something 
                else and try to increase what I know in life because 
                the pursuit to better myself; mind, body, 
                and soul is like a fire I can't put out. 
                So I'm entering the exciting world of web development! 
                I hope to use what I know to 
                maaaaaaybe make menus for future up and coming restaurant 
                owners and help them in their pursuit of 
                online content to further everyone's love of sushi!
